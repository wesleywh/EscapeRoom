# EscapeRoom
Just a lot of helpful scripts and hardware setup that I have been building for my own, just for fun, escape room.

## RC522 W/ Arduino Nano
### PIN SETUP

|RC522 Pin|Arudino Nano Pin|
|----|----|
|3.3V|3.3V|
|RST|D9|
|GND|GND|
|MISO|D12|
|MOSI|D11|
|SCK|D13|
|SDA|D10|

## Server Scripts
These scripts make use of `python`,`bash`, and `javascript`.

For the python scripts you need to install the following:
```
pip install serial
pip install flask
pip install pyserial
pip install flask_cors
```
`serial` & `pyserial` is to read the serial connection for the arudino
`flask` is to run a backend api server that our javascript frontend will call via `jquery` ajax.
`flask_cors` is to make this callable from different ip address so the javascript can be hosted anywhere and still call the backend python api server.
